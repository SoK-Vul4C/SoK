write(remoteAddr); // Buggy Line
```

The issue is that the `write` method is used without properly handling `null` values for `remoteAddr`. When `remoteAddr` is `null`, it should be replaced with an empty string to prevent NullPointerException.

Here is the fixed version of the function:

```java
if (remoteAddr == null) {
    write("");
} else {
    write(remoteAddr);
}
