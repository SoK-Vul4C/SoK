## 4. Usage

Please ensure that you have properly installed docker and Docker SDK for Python  before using.

Following is a startup command for vul4c you can invoke it on selected repair tool and benchmark.

```
python3 Framework/vul4c.py --tool "Vulnfix" --software "libxml2" --CVEID "CVE-2017-5969" 
```

You can find the results in the folder `vul4c-result`,and the folder where the results will be stored will be named ` $tool_$CVEID_$timestamp`
